Yesterday marked my final day at Bridgewater. It's been an exhilarating ride building trading engines and writing trading algorithms with some of the most talented and tenacious people in the industry. I'm giving myself time to gather my reflections around the experience -- more on that to come.

In April I'll be landing at Madhive, where I'll be helping build the next generation of adtech infrastructure. Until then I'll be taking advantage of my newfound lack of trading restrictions by going absolutely diamond hands on some GME.
