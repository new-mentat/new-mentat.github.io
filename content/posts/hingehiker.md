## A Call to Action

It’s 2020, Covid is on the upsurge, a divisive election looms on the horizon, and the downfall of democracy seems all but inevitable. Flicking through Instagram, the following ad appears on your screen. It’s a call to action, a shining, golden arm gloriously beckoning amidst the chaos.

![Hello, old friend](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2160/1*Zm6niSMU66X_Id_T-H8Zow.jpeg)*Hello, old friend*

Fulfilling your duty as a heroic individual, you download and open the app. Immediately
you are confronted by [Charon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon), ferryman of the
River Styx, in his mortal manifestation as the Hinge welcome screen, demanding payment for
transport into the Hinge underworld. The cost of entry? A well thought out answer to the
primordial question that is: who are you and why are **you** fit to serve as anyone’s
significant other? And thus our journey begins…

## Act 1: Crossing the Styx

Hinge’s main value prop is that it allows you to display *slivers* of your identity beyond whatever pictures you’ve selected, albeit in the form of 150 character capped responses to a list of curated questions. This three question identity embodies the ideal form of self expression for attention span deficient millennials, and strikes neutral ground between “scary” apps a la Tinder and “geezer” apps a la Plenty of Fish (Instagram DM’s and Craigslist deserve honorable mentions here — the former reserved for those with diamond-tier social capital, the latter for those who are truly courageous).

Unless you are bestowed with divine physical attractiveness, entry to the Hinge universe and the world of online dating is no insignificant feat. If you stop to think about it, the online identity you construct is likely to *drastically* alter your romantic trajectory (yes this is true, yes this is absurd). And so, I now gift you the advice passed from adventurers who have safely passed through this hellscape into the land of fulfilling relationships: construct your profile responses with the gravity of your romantic destiny in mind, and use timeless and universal principles to guide you through the process.

One principle I hold for dating is to strive for polarization. It’s crucial to express the essence of your identity to a suitor as honestly and swiftly as possible, if only for the very practical and selfish reason of finding a partner who’s compatible with you. In real life there’s an art to this. There exist dimensions of your personality only appreciated with a nuanced understanding of you and consequently, ought to be revealed over time. On Hinge, this art becomes a tricky form of dark magic, due to the innumerable inflections and intonations in which your reader may interpret your responses.

In a nutshell, your goal is to simultaneously separate yourself from the nameless horde of normies (“Favorite show? The office”, “Most controversial opinion? Pineapples on pizza”), while guard-railing yourself against entering fatal edgelord territory (“Ideal first date? Murder suicide”, “Never have I ever? Been truly happy”). That said, if your favorite show is the office AND your most controversial opinion is that you like pineapples on pizza AND you want to meet other likeminded individuals, I pass no judgement and all the power to you.

With your answers in the bag, you’re now faced with an arguably harder challenge: photo selection. Sadly you have less artistic freedom here as you’re limited by 1. your raw physical attractiveness and 2. the tendency of your friends to capture said attractiveness in JPEGs.

In regards to cultivating your display of “hot pics” I have two bits of advice: 1. ensure your pictures synergize with your responses to form an ideologically consistent Hinge aesthetic and 2. avoid picking any images of yourself accompanied by one extremely attractive member of the opposite sex. If you have an urge to partake in the latter, please ask yourself exactly what you’re trying to signal by doing this.

## Act 2: Entering the Fields of Asphodel (Hinge Limbo)

You’ve created the ultimate profile, the most true expression of self you could conceive, and you’ve”liked” a couple of people. Now, hopefully you have a few matches. If no such matches exist, revisit step 1 or invent time travel and then genetically engineer yourself to be more attractive.

![*If you are a male with a fragile ego and have no matches, ease your suffering with the following knowledge: [studies show](https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/) dating app economies follow a highly unequal Pareto distribution, with ~20% of the most attractive males receiving ~80% of all the attention.*](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2200/1*0fP0TYf6tFZCuBhLZx4UNw.png)*If you are a male with a fragile ego and have no matches, ease your suffering with the following knowledge: [studies show](https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/) dating app economies follow a highly unequal Pareto distribution, with ~20% of the most attractive males receiving ~80% of all the attention.*

With matches in the queue but no real dates secured, you’re firmly in Hinge Limbo, and it’s time to initiate First Contact. One valid option is to say nothing, and forever suspend your matches in a state of superposition, akin to [Schrodinger’s cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger%27s_cat). This strategy insulates you from any negative emotions that may result from someone ghosting you after First Contact, but also guarantees a cold indefinite stay in Limbo.

An alternative approach is to say something, anything, in hopes that some poor sap will eventually bite. Sometimes this inexplicably ends up working; more often it does not. The resulting failure is rarely spectacular, as most people simply don’t respond.

The tried and true, battle-tested option taken b most emotionally healthy hingers is to utilize the answers / pictures displayed on a match’s profile to bootstrap a conversation. If you do get a response, the success or failure of your pursuit is now entirely up to you, but heed the following advice: in Limbo, it is of utmost importance to escape the confines of Hinge as soon as humanly possible. This is to prevent both yourself and your match from falling into the trap of Hinge Nihilism, which is our next topic of discussion.

## Act 3: Scaling the Pit of Tartarus (Hinge Nihilism)

At some inflection point in your Hinge saga, usually a couple weeks in, it’s prudent to pause and evaluate your mental well-being. Have you gone through countless fruitless cycles of matching, invoking conversation, and losing chemistry before ever going on a date? Have potential romantic partners morphed into a homogenous sea of Abstract Hinge Entities? Have you unwittingly become a Hinge Troll? If so, you are likely suffering from Hinge Nihilism, a condition that results from the utterly dehumanizing process of swiping left or right on people you will never meet up with in real life.

The insight here is that life on Hinge exists in a parallel universe from your extant reality and is not a barometer of your capacity for romantic success. Despite all the sweat (tears) put into your profile which receives lackluster matches, and despite the nights wasted conducting conversations that fizzle out into the ether, you must stay strong in your conviction that you are a Beautiful Human who is capable of romantic fulfillment. You must love both yourself and the art of hinging unconditionally. At least, this is what I tell myself.

## Act 4: Elysium

If you’ve avoided the siren calls of Hinge Nihilism and the icy grasp of Hinge Limbo, you should now have a date scheduled. You’ve made it to the promised land, and this app has done everything you’ve asked of it. Ahead of you spans the treacherous land of Real Human Interaction, and to quote Natasha Bedingfield “The rest is unwritten”. ❤

In an ideal world, I’d end this guide with a polaroid of myself and my girlfriend picking apples or painting together or something. However, this girlfriend is still conceptual and does not yet exist, so I instead leave you with the following screenshot of an ex Hinge date turned close friend, sadistically enjoying herself in the depths of Limbo.
